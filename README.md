# Price Prediction Project with Machine Learning

This project aims to create a web application that predicts prices based on input data, using a regression model and data scaling techniques. The application is deployed in a Docker environment, allowing for quick and reproducible setup.

## Features
- Price Prediction: The app allows users to predict prices based on input features provided by the user.
- Regression Model: A pre-trained regression model (regmodel.pkl) is used for making predictions.
- Data Scaling: Input data is scaled before being passed into the regression model using the scaling.pkl transformation file.
- Simple Web Interface: The application provides a user interface to interact with the model and get real-time predictions.
- Docker Deployment: The project is Dockerized, ensuring a quick and reliable setup in any environment.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
 - Python 3.7+
- Docker (if you want to use Docker)
- pip (for managing Python dependencies)
